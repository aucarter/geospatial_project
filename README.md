https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/processing-satellite-imagery/ - Mapbox tutorial on processing Satellite imagery. In general, I have been very impressed with the writings and visualizations created by Mapbox in recent years. Could be a good company to watch / collaborate with over the next couple of years.

https://medium.com/planet-stories/a-gentle-introduction-to-gdal-part-1-a3253eb96082 - Great in depth tutorial on the tools that form the backbone of geospatial analysis. Covers things like projections, data sources, etc which could give you more background on the challenges in collecting goespatial data.

Let's do a hackathon one weekend and figure out how to "smooth" out clouds from satellite images. It's a really interesting statistical problem, and will unlock the RGB map print feature we were discussing!
